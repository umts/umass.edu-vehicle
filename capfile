    [internal] Touches up the released code. This is called by update_code \

    Prepares one or more servers for deployment. Before you can use any \
    of the Capistrano deployment tasks with your project, you will need to \
    make sure all of your servers have been prepared with `cap deploy:setup'. When \
    you add a new server to your cluster, you can easily run the setup task \
    on just that server by specifying the HOSTS environment variable:

      $ cap HOSTS=new.server.com deploy:setup

    It is safe to run this task on servers that have already been set up; it \
    will not destroy any deployed revisions or data.

    #requests to the deploy directory (ie /transit) to the current release
    #directory (ie /transit/current) behind-the-scenes.  This wouldn't be
    #necisary if we had controll over the server.
